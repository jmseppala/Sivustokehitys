       <h3><a href="#">Media query</a></h3>
        <p>Media query is a really important if not the most important part of responsive web design. 
		Media queries are used for adapting the site to different screen resolutions such as smartphone vs. high definition screen.
		A media query consists of a media type and one or more expressions which involve media features. Those features then resolve to either true or false. 
		So in other words what the media query does is: it allows certain conditions to be applied to different stylesheets to make websites fluid and fit all kinds of screen sizes.
		The result of the query is true if the media type specified in the media query matches the type of device the document is being displayed on. 
		Also all expressions in the media query need to be true. 
		When a media query is true, the corresponding style sheet or rules are applied, following the normal cascading rules.</p>
		
		  <h3><a href="#">Layout changes with media queries</a></h3>
		
		<p>
		One of the most important things about responsive web design is the layout changes that occur when resizing the browser window or browsing the
		site on different devices. For example the number of the columns used may became smaller when using a mobile device or the navigation may change to
        more mobile friendly layout and things like that. 
		<strong>Just compare the navigation of this page between full-sized browser window and small window. </strong>
        Those kind of things are set with media queries. Luckily with Foundation5 many of these basic layout changes works good right out of the box
        but it is important to get to know media queries so adjustments can be made to the site when needed.		
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong> Take a look at the code example below. </strong> Foundation does not seem to change font size by default when screen size changes so I added this little code to the foundation.css
        file. At first the media type is set to @media screen and then there is the max-width value inside the brackets.
		The query below will apply only to a device that has a screen and only if the width of the browser window is 340 pixels at maximum. Otherwise that particular query will be ignored.
		<strong>Try to change the browser window size to less than 400px to see when the media query below kicks in. </strong>
		There are many more media types that you can define such as handheld, print, etc. You can also take a look at the wedding store example on this tutorial site
		to see media queries in action.
		</p>
		
     <p> @media only screen and (max-width: 400px) {  <br />
       p { font-size: 0.8em; } <br />
        }
	</p>	
		
     <strong> As an media query exercise, copy the code above and put it in the foundation.css file.  </strong>
	<p> After that you can experiment with the font-size and max-width properties and then resize the browser windows to see the changes. 
	 You can also try to add different media queries. For example you could try to add a font size for a handheld device at some particular width-property. 
	 Remember that you can use max-width and min-width properties. </p>
